# OpenSearch configuration is broken into 2 sections: connections and
# indexes.  The connections section has one named entry per OpenSearch
# instance; those connection names are referenced from the indexes.
connections:
    localhost:  # this is the connection "name"
        url: https://localhost:9200
        auth:
            username: admin
            password: admin
    my_opensearch:  # this is a second connection "name"
        url: https://opensearch.example.com:9200/
        auth:
            username: hunter
            password: password

# An OpenSearch instance can have many indexes.  For each index that
# will be available as a Kestrel datasource, create a named entry here
# that references a connection name from above.  You can also specify
# some metadata about the index, such as the field name to be used as
# the timestamp, the format of that timestamp, and (optionally) a
# filename containing a kestrel data model mapping, in YAML format.
# If no mapping is specified, that index will default to Kestrel's
# built-in Elastic Common Schema (ECS) data model mapping.
indexes:
    winlogbeat-mordor:  # index name in the "localhost" instance
        connection: localhost
        timestamp: "@timestamp"
        timestamp_format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"
        data_model_mapping: "custom_mapping.yaml"
    some-index:  # index name in the "my_opensearch" instance
        connection: my_opensearch
        timestamp: "@timestamp"
        timestamp_format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"
