Kestrel Threat Hunting Language
===============================

*Hunt faster, easier, and with more fun!*

Kestrel threat hunting language provides an abstraction for threat hunters to
focus on the high-value and composable threat hypothesis development instead of
specific realization of hypothesis testing with heterogeneous data sources,
threat intelligence, and public or proprietary analytics.

`Kestrel GitHub repo`_ is the official portal of everything Kestrel beyond this
documentation: news, demo, tutorial, sandbox, huntbooks, analytics, blogs,
talks, community entrances, and more.
