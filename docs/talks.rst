Kestrel was debuted at RSA Conference 2021: `The Game of Cyber Threat Hunting:
The Return of the Fun`_ with the goal of an :ref:`overview/index:Human-Machine
Symbiosis`, its key design concepts :ref:`language:Entity-Based Reasoning` and
:ref:`language:Composable Hunt Flow`, and a `small-enterprise APT hunting
demo`_ with TTP pattern matching, cross-host provenance tracking,
TI-enrichment, machine learning analytics, and more.

Kestrel was further introduced to the threat hunting community at `SANS Threat
Hunting Summit 2021`_ in session `Compose Your Hunts With Reusable Knowledge
and Share Your Huntbook With the Community`_ to facilitate huntbook
composition, sharing, and reuse---from simple single hunt step demos (TTP
pattern matching, provenance tracking, and data visualization analytics) to
complex comprehensive hunt flow composition.

Kestrel, together with `STIX-shifter`_, `Elastic`_, and `SysFlow`_ constitute
the *open hunting stack* demoed at Black Hat Europe 2021: `An Open Stack for
Threat Hunting in Hybrid Cloud With Connected Observability`_. A supply chain
attack variant across a hybrid cloud (two clouds and on-premises machines) was
hunted in the arsenal session.

Kestrel was demoed at `Infosec Jupyterthon 2021`_ in session: `Reason Cyber
Campaigns With Kestrel`_. The live hunting demo explained the basics of Kestrel
throughout the discovery of the hybrid cloud APT campaign developed for our
Black Hat Europe 2021 session.

Kestrel will be discussed at `SC eSummit on Threat Hunting & Offense
Security`_ in an interview session `The ABCs of Kestrel: How the threat-hunting
language enables efficiencies & interoperability`_. The session will discuss
the history, mission, key idea, community, and stories of Kestrel for
threat hunters, enterprise executives, and security researchers.
