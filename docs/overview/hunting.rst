Cyberthreat hunting is the planning and developing of threat discovery
procedures on against new and customized advanced persistent threats (APT).
Cyberthreat hunting is comprised of several activities such as:

#. Understanding the security measurements in the target environment.
#. Thinking about potential threats escaping existing defenses.
#. Obtaining useful observations from system and network activities.
#. Developing threat hypotheses.
#. Revising threat hypotheses iteratively with the last two steps.
#. Confirming new threats.

Threat hunters create customized intrusion detection system (IDS) instances
every day with a combination of data source queries, complex data processing,
machine learning, threat intelligence enrichment, proprietary detection logic,
and more. Threat hunters take advantage of scripting languages, spreadsheets,
whiteboards, and other tools to plan and execute their hunts. In traditional
cyberthreat hunting, many pieces of hunts are written against specific data
sources and data types, which makes the domain knowledge in them not reusable,
and hunters need to express the same knowledge again and again for different
hunts.

*That's slow and tedious!*

Can we improve it?
