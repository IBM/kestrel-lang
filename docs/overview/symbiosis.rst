In traditional threat hunting, hunters answer both questions of *what to hunt*
and *how to hunt*. While there is no doubt that human intelligence and creativity are
the irreplaceable secret sauce of asking and answering the questions of the
*what*, it is a waste of time to manually answer most questions of
the *how*, which is just a translation between the knowledge in *what* and
execution instructions specified by different hunting platforms.

We know that machines are good at solving translation problems with well-defined
grammars fast.

Why not create an *efficient cyberthreat hunting symbiosis* with humans and
machines to ask and answer different types of hunting questions and enjoy their
strengths and values?
