- README.rst misses images when rendered at non-github sites, e.g., PyPI.

1.3.0 (2022-04-14)
==================

Added
-----

- internal data model upgraded to firepit 2.0.0 with full graph-like database schema:

  - new firepit data schema named `normalized <https://firepit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html>`_.
  - the normalized schema extracts/recognizes entities/SCOs from STIX observations and stores them and their relations.
  - the normalized schema fully enables a Kestrel variable to refer to a list of homogeneous entities as a view in a relational-DB table.
  - older hunts will need to be re-executed.

- syntax upgrade: introducing the language construct *expression* to process a variable, e.g., adding a ``WHERE`` clause, and the processed variable can be

  - assigned to another variable, so one does not need another ``GET`` command with a STIX pattern to do filtering.
  - passed to ``DISP``, so ``DISP`` is naturally upgraded to support many clauses such as ``SORT``, ``LIMIT``, etc.

- new syntax for initial events handling besides entities:

  - entities in a variable do not have timestamps anymore; previously all observations of the entities were listed in a variable with timestamps.
  - use the function ``TIMESTAMPED()`` to wrap a variable into an expression when the user needs timestamps of the observations/events in which the entities appeared. This is useful for analyzing and visualizing events of entities through time, e.g., time series analysis of visited ``ipv4-addr`` entities in a variable.

- unit tests:

  - 5 more unit tests for command ``FIND``.
  - 2 more unit tests for command ``SAVE``.
  - 2 unit tests for expression ``TIMESTAMPED()``.

- new syntax added to language reference documentation
  
  - ``TIMESTAMPED``
  - ``DISP``
  - assign

- repo updates:

  - Kestrel logo created.
  - GOVERNANCE.rst including *versioning*, *release procedure*, *vulnerability disclosure*, and more.

Removed
-------

- the copy command is removed (replaced by the more generic assign command).

Changed
-------

- repo front-page restructured to make it shorter but providing more information/links.
- the overview page of Kestrel doc is turned into a directory of sections. The URL of the page is changed from `overview.html <https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_ to `overview <https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview>`_.
