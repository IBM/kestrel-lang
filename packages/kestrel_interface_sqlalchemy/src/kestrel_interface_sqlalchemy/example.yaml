# SQLAlchemy configuration is broken into 2 sections: connections and
# datasources.  The connections section has one named entry per
# SqlAlchemy instance; those connection names are referenced from the
# datasources.
connections:
    my_data_lake:
        url: sqlite:////home/pcoccoli/events.db  # SQLAlchemy connection string
        table_creation_permission: true  # this helps decide how to load cache

# A single database can have many tables.  For each table that will be
# available as a Kestrel datasource, create a named entry here that
# references a connection name from above.  You can also specify some
# metadata about the tables, such as the column name to be used as the
# timestamp, the format of that timestamp, and (optionally) a filename
# containing a kestrel data model mapping, in YAML format.
datasources:
    events:  # This is also the data source name you'll use in your hunts
        connection: my_data_lake # references the connection info above
        table: my_events  # actual SQL table name
        timestamp: "@timestamp"
        timestamp_format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%fZ"
        data_model_map: "my_events_mapping.yaml"
