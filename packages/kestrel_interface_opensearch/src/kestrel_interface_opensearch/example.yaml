# OpenSearch configuration is broken into 2 sections: connections and
# datasources.  The connections section has one named entry per
# OpenSearch instance; those connection names are referenced from the
# datasources.
connections:
    localhost:  # this is the connection "name"
        url: https://localhost:9200
        verify_certs: false  # For trusted, self-signed certs only!
        auth:
            username: admin
            password: admin
    my_opensearch:  # this is a second connection "name"
        url: https://opensearch.example.com:9200/
        auth:
            username: hunter
            password: password

# An OpenSearch instance can have many indexes.  For each index
# pattern that will be available as a Kestrel datasource, create a
# named entry here that references a connection name from above.  You
# can also specify some metadata about the indexes matched by the
# index pattern, such as the field name to be used as the timestamp,
# the format of that timestamp, and (optionally) a filename containing
# a kestrel data model mapping, in YAML format.  If no mapping is
# specified, that index will default to Kestrel's built-in Elastic
# Common Schema (ECS) data model mapping.
datasources:
    winlogbeat-mordor:  # this is the name you would use in your hunt
        connection: localhost  # this is the "localhost" connection above
